										<p class="mx-auto">The population of Taiwan is approximately 23.57 million,
											spread across a total land area of
											about 36,000 km2; it is the seventeenth most densely populated country in
											the world, with a population density of about 651 inhabitants per square
											kilometer.<br>
											The original population of the island of Taiwan and its
											associated islands consists of a variety of Taiwanese indigenous
											peoples.They have been found to share languages with the
											Austronesian family and mitochondrial DNA contribution with island peoples
											of Southeast Asia and the Pacific.<br>
											Immigration of Han Chinese to the Penghu islands started as early as the
											13th century, while settlement of the main island occurred from the 16th
											century. It was stimulated by Dutch traders importing workers from Fujian in
											the 17th century. According to governmental statistics, in the early 21st
											century, more than 95% of the Republic of China's population are Han Chinese
											of East Asian ethnicity, while 2.3% are Taiwanese aborigines of Austronesian
											ethnicity. 85% of Taiwanese have some level of aboriginal ancestry.

												Researches on historical linguistics

												In the last 400 years, several waves of Chinese emigrations brought

												<p class="mx-auto">Taiwan's culture presents multifacetedly in different
													era backgrounds.
													From the earliest Austronesian culture, ancient Fujian and Guangdong
													culture, the early Western civilization brought by the Dutch,
													Portuguese, and
													Spanish colonists. The Minnan
													culture and Hakka brought by the large-scale reclamation of the Han
													people. Han Culture, Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and other
													religions began to
													influence the region, and later mixed with Japanese cultural
													influence during the Japanese rule.
													In the middle of the 20th century, the US military stationed in
													Taiwan was influenced by
													American culture after the war, and the cultural revival of local
													and Taiwanese aborigines In the middle and late twentieth century, a
													large number of ASEAN countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam
													emigrated to Taiwan, which
													caused a rich collision with Taiwan’s multilingual and
													cultural. Therefore, Taiwanese culture has traditional and modern
													aspects,
													and the cultural category with Taiwan as the main body is gradually
													established.
